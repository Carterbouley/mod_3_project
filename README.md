- Our project will analyse the effect of Trumpism. His tweets have stated that this is the best economy ever. However labeling a single economic era as the greatest in history is subjective because thereâ€™s no agreed-upon metric. 

So, given his likelyhood of election in 2020 (betfair implied odds suggest he has a 40.9% chance of winnig). We have decided to test his statement using a variety of economic indicators, including s&p 500 growth, unemployment rate, total public debt, US trade balance, GDP growth, (house prices?).

Through comparing to other presidents, if the results are significantly different (as opposed to being attributed to market cycles) we could have a better idea on whether to expect these trends to continue.
- The S&P 500 data is collected from yale economics department, using the Quandle API to access it.

Hypthesis_1:
    
    h0 = Trump has no effect on the rate of growth of the s&p 500
    h1 = Trump is increasing the rate of growth of the s&p 500
    
Hypothesis_2:

    h0 = Trump has no effect on the rate of unemployment in the usa
    h1 = Trump is increasing the rate of growth of the s&p 500

Hypothesis_3:
